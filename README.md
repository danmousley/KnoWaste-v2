<h1>KnoWaste v2</h1>

<p>Hi all, we're going to be building version 2.0 of KnoWaste.</p>
<p>KnoWaste is a food preording system that aims to eliminate foodwaste by giving catering institutions accurate information.</p>

<h2>BootStrap</h2> 
<p>We will be using the grid layout system from BootStrap. *code example*</p>





<h2>Naming Folders & Files</h2>
<p>In order to ensure compatiably between Unix and Windows operating systems it's important that we name all our files and folders in lowercase.<br>For example, we would name a component nav.jsx as opposed to Nav.jsx.</p>

<h2>File Structure</h2>
<p>All components should be that belong to one page should be created within the pages folder. Child components should be nested within the folder of their parent. For example, if navlink was a child component of register the file structure would look like this.</p>
              
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/P5nD6PD/fs.png" alt="fs" border="0"></a> 

<p>All components that are shared between pages should be contained within the shared folder as opposed to pages</p>
